# Booking Brains 
This project is part of the Booking Brains backend architecture, serving as a **consumer** service for messages from **Apache Kafka**. Its primary purpose is to receive error logs generated by another service and persist them in a database for long-term storage and analysis.

## Functionality Overview
-  Kafka Message Consumption: The project continuously listens for new messages from the `error-logs-topic` in Kafka.
-  Data Persistence: The received logs are deserialized into C# objects and persisted in a database for analysis and reporting.
-  Hosted Service Architecture: The consumer functionality runs as a background service (`IHostedService`), ensuring that it operates continuously regardless of incoming HTTP requests.

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core Web API: The foundational framework for the project.
- Apache Kafka: The event streaming platform.
- Confluent.Kafka: The library for connecting to Kafka, which includes the **Producer**, **Consumer**, and **AdminClient** APIs..
- Entity Framework Core: For database management.
- SQL Server: The database option for storing the logs.
- Docker: Used to set up the Kafka service.

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop: To run the Kafka instance.
- .NET SDK: Version 6 or newer.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aminatpwk/BookingApp-Kafka-Logging.git
    cd BookingApp-Logging
    ```

2.  **Configure the database**:
    * Update the **connection string** in your `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` file.
    * Run database migrations to create the `ErrorLogs` table:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update
        ```

3.  **Connect to Kafka**:
    * This service connects to Kafka at `localhost:9092`.
    * Ensure that a Kafka instance is already running at this address (typically started with Docker from the **Producer** project).

4.  **Run the application**:
    * From Visual Studio, press `F5`, or use the command line:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    * The consumer will automatically start listening for messages as soon as the application launches.
